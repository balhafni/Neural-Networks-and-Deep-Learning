Playing around with Neural Nets....


## 1) Logistic Regression with a Neural Net mindset: 
A simple logistic regression classifier to recognize images of cats with up to 70% accuracy.

## 2) Planar Classifier:
A simple classifier that uses gradient descent and only a single hidden layer.

## 3) Sign Digits Recognizer:
An optimized deep neural net that uses mini-batch gradient descent to recognize sign digits from 0 to 5 (using Tensorflow YAY!)
